This folder contains two example of python codes to generate netCDF file that are in compliance to
IOOS and NCEI requirements. The *_atm.py is for atmospheric data and the other (*_ocn.py) is for
oceanographic data. The main difference of the two is how multiple vertical positions records are 
registered or handled in netCDF.
